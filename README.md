# Airbnb Data Analysis
Airbnb is an online marketplace connecting people who want to rent out their property with people looking for accommodations, typically for short stays. Airbnb offers hosts a relatively easy way to earn some income from their property. Guests often find that Airbnb rentals are cheaper and homier than hotels.
Airbnb Inc. (Airbnb) operates an online platform for hospitality services. The company provides a mobile application (app) that enables users to list, discover, and book unique accommodations worldwide. The app allows hosts to list their properties for lease and enables guests to rent or lease on a short-term basis, which includes vacation rentals, apartment rentals, homestays, castles, tree houses and hotel rooms.
The company has a presence in China, India, Japan, Australia, Canada, Austria, Germany, Switzerland, Belgium, Denmark, France, Italy, Norway, Portugal, Russia, Spain, Sweden, the UK, and others. Airbnb is headquartered in San Francisco, California, the US.
# Problem Statement
This project aims to analyze Airbnb data & perform data cleaning and preparation, develop interactive geospatial visualizations, and create dynamic plots to gain insights into pricing variations, availability patterns, and location-based trends in the Airbnb marketplace.
# Take Away Skills
The following skills were acquired from the project:
- PYTHON
- DATA PREPROCESSING
- EDA
- PANDAS
- VISUALIZATION
- STREAMLIT GUI
- POWERBI
# Work Flow
 - Data Collection: Gather data from Airbnb's public API or other available sources. Collect information on listings, hosts, reviews, pricing, and location data.
 - Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the data to handle missing values, and outliers, and ensure data quality. Convert data types, handle duplicates, and standardize formats.
 - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conduct exploratory data analysis to understand the distribution and patterns in the data. Explore relationships between variables and identify potential insights.
 - Visualization: Create visualizations to represent key metrics and trends. Use charts, graphs, and maps to convey information effectively. Consider using tools like Matplotlib, Seaborn, or Plotly for visualizations.
 - Geospatial Analysis: Utilize geospatial analysis to understand the geographical distribution of listings. Map out popular areas, analyze neighbourhood characteristics, and visualize pricing variations.
 - Dashboard Creation: Utilize Tableau or Power BI to create a comprehensive dashboard that presents key insights from your analysis. 
# Conclusion
This project aims to analyze Airbnb data & perform data cleaning and preparation, and develop interactive geospatial visualizations based on trends in the Airbnb marketplace.
